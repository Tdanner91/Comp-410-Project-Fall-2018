# Comp-410-Project-Fall-2018
This repository is designed for Groups 1 &amp; 2 during the Fall 2018 Comp 410 Project

From the notes I took in today's class, I've outlined some requirements we'll need for our execution engine.
Using the requirements I have created some goals. Each of these should be pretty doable as a solo task, but we
can always reassign manpower as needed.

Requirements:
  1)Create a website that will provide a list of devices
  2)Create a scheduler (dispatcher) to execute tests (scripts provided by test case team) on devices (provided by DUT)
  3)Execution engine will need to incorporate XML to distribute results for the database
  4)Execution keeps a record log for executions

Ideal Tasks:
  1) Design a web interface
  2) Create a dispatcher/scheduler to manage devices and scripts
  3) Create documentation for our interface
  4) Create a way for our website to run selected script on selected device
  5) Create a way to send results from script execution to the database

Other shit that we should probably do (and can upload here):
  1) Create a state diagram*

*Creating the diagram should help us stay on track for troubleshooting. I'll probably take care of this within the next few days.
